# Contribution Guidelines

A really solid way to contribute right now is by breaking my program in any way you can and filing an issue or pinging me about it.

Wanting to contribute code! Awesome! First, I'd recommend at least glancing through https://ktool.cynder.me/en/latest/ktool.html if you haven't already, as it documents the majority of the code flow.
