# Contribution Guidelines

A really solid way to contribute right now is by breaking my program in any way you can and filing an issue or pinging me about it.


I would not recommend contributing code substantially till I reach a stable API with version 1.0.0 (and i have no idea when this will be).

This is because there's a solid 25% chance i've rewritten half the project and not yet pushed it.

I am making fairly good progress, and will likely bump to 1.0.0 a few weeks after chained fixup processing is finished.


If you would like to contribute a bugfix that you need, but you cant quite figure out what you need to fix, shoot me a message,
and i will likely be able to point you to the problem and help with a fix. Don't worry about code style/guidelines at the moment, 
I can handle that if you're unsure about something.
