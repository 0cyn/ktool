### notes

The Chained Fixup code within this project is based upon code I wrote for the MachO-View plugin 
within BinaryNinja, which at time of writing is located at https://github.com/Vector35/view-macho

### Image notes

For the logo for this project, I used SF Pro for the font.

The overlay for the text itself is this actually gorgeous painting by Martina Bulkov√°:
